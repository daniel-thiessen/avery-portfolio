                description: `"A room for holding" is an attempt to unpack my relationship to being responsible for the "literal survival of an actual human person."

Through this dance, I'm exploring my ambivalent and joyous surrender to carrying, waiting, watching.

I'm considering these acts of care as a continuous thread, where small actions, repeated over time, quietly accumulate and contribute to a larger pattern of attention.

                description: `"Here We Are" explores the artifice of identity.

Together, Avery and Kate have created states of being that attempt to consolidate multiple versions of self.

The attempt of presenting oneself in a neat package fails and dissolves in different ways. Cracks in formality and persona soften the performer and make space for multiple identities to exist.

                description: `Sally’s World is a new interdisciplinary work, involving dance, live music, and text. The work explores a singular character's shift from a composed, performance facade to an unhinged, private experience.

 

The collaborators drew on their personal relationships with the universal themes of grief and joy to craft a performance that reveals the struggle and pain of a crippling inner monologue. Using improvisation as a basis for creation and exploration, a distinct yet ever-shifting fictional character was birthed. This character was researched through experimenting with adopting one another's histories, amalgamating identities, and shifting personas. A character who has the will to conquer her relentless anxieties but lacks the tools to do so began to appear. Through the marriage of movement, sound, and text, the work aims to explore this intimate and isolating experience.  

​

The collaborators use this project to practice excellence in interdisciplinary collaboration. They aim to create a creative process in which movement and sound inform one another equally.

The film finds a single dancer unearthing, tangling, and deconstructing habitual movement patterns and rhythms. This process manifests in a physical investigation of calculated precision. Contrasting environments and camera perspectives work to challenge and disrupt this intimate experience. What is lost in the camera's translation of this experience? What feelings of intimacy are gained, forgotten, and revealed?

The work simultaneously deconstructs and celebrates the worn-in patterning that the body quietly carries. While exploring a specific way of being, the solo tangles demonstrative precision with unconscious flow. Known movements are dissected again and again until they transform into foreign pathways. These pathways are then crafted into hyper-choreographed sequences of movement. This process revealed the nuance and capacity that survives in, and perhaps because of, restriction.

Participants had the opportunity to practice showing work, articulating their ideas, and offering feedback.

Together they are interested in creating a space for dancers of all backgrounds and experiences to come together and exchange ideas, skills, and techniques with one another. Training Share was born from Avery's craving to continue learning and collaborating with her peer group beyond a post-secondary training program, and to connect with other dancers within the community. 

 

There is no single teacher and instead everyone takes turns offering knowledge and learning from one another, with no obligation other than to respect the shared use of the space. 

Training Share is a place to engage with Vancouver's broad and inspiring community of dance artists. It is a resource to grow your practice, both technically and artistically, outside of a formalized school, class or contract. We hope this initiative strengthens our community by developing new connections and future collaborations among peers.

Training Share is made possible through the organizational support and full financial sponsorship from Company 605, as well as the CADA/West Studio Subsidy Program.

Other than respecting the shared use of the space and the people occupying it, there are no expectations on how to use the space. There are no obligations, responsibilities, or unspoken desires on how to take advantage of FREE SPACE.

This is an experiment on sharing space together. Some questions Avery has for this experiment:

Do we know how to be together without being told? What different ways can we be together? Can collaboration exist without a leader? How do we use the resources and people around us to inform our own decision making?

Other questions I recognize:

Is anything really free? Is there always an unspoken expectation?

​

These are bodies at a loss, gathering together in a stream of movement. a state of recovery. seeking and sifting. grasping for an anchor. it is at once real and science fiction, digital and embodied.

 

This liminal space holds a confrontation with the promise of future, a collision between our inexorable, ecstatic draw towards the limitless new, and a continuous loss — a perpetual state of mourning for what we are leaving behind. there is no answer. It is overwhelming and incomplete. there is only the stream, and the blurring fragments of what we attempt to bring with us.

​

Created collaboratively with the ensemble, lossy is a shared ritual of transcendence. It is a carefree conjuring of a shiny new future “us”, and a collective grieving for what the future may no longer hold, once we finally arrive.

Ten extraordinary dancers draw on all their strength, speed, and agility to power through the explosive choreography, striving to find moments of emotional connection amidst the visceral intensity. Pathways questions our ability or inability to connect with one another and what makes us react more strongly to some than to others.
