description: "\"Here We Are\" explores the artifice of identity. Together, Avery and Kate have created states of being that attempt to consolidate multiple versions of self. The attempt of presenting oneself in a neat package fails and dissolves in different ways. Cracks in formality and persona soften the performer and make space for multiple identities to exist. Performed by Kate Franklin Presented at Left of PuSh 2023 & Accelerate 6.0 (January 2023)"
